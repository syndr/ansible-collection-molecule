```bash

 export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="blahblahblahblah"
 export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="hurpderpherpderpdpeypedpderpyderp"
 export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="hurpderpherpderpdpeypedpderpyderpahahwhizbanglotsofstuffblablablabla"
```

The `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` variable is only required if you are using temporary credentials.

Full role configuration options are available in the `defaults/main.yml` file.

Example Playbook
----------------

This role is intended to be used via the `molecule.platform` role that is included with this collection, and should not be referenced directly in a playbook.

Configuration is done via the `platforms` section of the `molecule.yml` file in your Molecule scenario directory.

```yaml
platforms:
  - name: ec2-rockylinux9
    type: ec2
    image: "ami-067daee80a6d36ac0"
    instance_type: "t3.micro"
    region: "us-east-2"
    vpc_id: "vpc-12345678"
    vpc_subnet_id: "subnet-12345678"
```

To utilize this role, use the `platform` role that is included with this collection in your `create.yml` playbook!

```yaml
- name: Create
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Create platform(s)
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: syndr.molecule.platform
      vars:
        platform_name: "{{ item.name }}"
        platform_state: present
        platform_type: "{{ item.type }}"
        platform_molecule_cfg: "{{ item }}"
      loop: "{{ molecule_yml.platforms }}"
      loop_control:
        label: item.name

# We want to avoid errors like "Failed to create temporary directory"
- name: Validate that inventory was refreshed
  hosts: molecule
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Check uname
      ansible.builtin.raw: uname -a
      register: result
      changed_when: false

    - name: Display uname info
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ result.stdout }}"
